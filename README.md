Startup App Project for CS 260

# purpose
This file is for creating a startup app to get hands-on experience with web design for

## notes from first assignment
It was nice getting the opportunity to see how to navigate the merge conflict tools in VS code.

#Elevator Pitch: GetOrganized
Have you ever wanted a simple, comprehensive portal for any productivity related utilities? GetOrganized
will enable you to create a full todo-list, organize these tasks on an interactive calendar, and add and 
view notes related to these tasks all in one wholistic software. In the application, you will be able to 
switch between three straightforward screens to view these different features and get organized and 
optimized, unlocking your true productive potential!

# Features:
### TodoList (shown below)
- allows users to create, complete, edit, and delete tasks
- tasks will have a date on which they are due, a description, as well as the ability to be grouped by custom tags
- in the "TodoList" page you can filter which tasks are shown, search by task title, and choose how tasks are sorted

### Notes (shown below)
- Notes can be created for different tag groups for tasks or groups on their own, i.e if you have a chemistry class a "Chem 101" tag could be used so that you can view just the notes that you've taken for chemistry
- Notes can be assigned to individual tasks to describe how the task should be completed or other important details
- Notes' page allows user to filter and search through existing notes
