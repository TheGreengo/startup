# Elevator Pitch: GetOrganized
Have you ever wanted a simple, comprehensive portal for any and all productivity related utilities? GetOrganized
will enable you to create a full todo-list, organize these tasks on an interactive calendar, and add and 
view notes related to these tasks all in one wholistic application. In GetOrganized, you will be able to 
switch between three straightforward screens to view these different features, enabling you to get organized and 
optimized, unlocking your true productive potential!

# Features:
### TodoList (shown below)
- allows users to create, complete, edit, view, and delete tasks
- tasks will have a date on which they are due, a description, and custom tags that they can be grouped by
- in the "TodoList" page you can filter which tag groups are shown, search by task title, and choose how tasks are sorted

### Notes (shown below)
- notes can be created for different task tag groups or tag groups of their own (i.e if you have a chemistry class a "Chem 101" tag could be used so that you can view just the notes that you've taken for chemistry)
- notes can be assigned to individual tasks to describe how the task should be completed or other important details
- notes' page allows user to filter and search through existing notes
